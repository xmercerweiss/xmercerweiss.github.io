# Educated

## Introduction
What do we mean when we refer to someone as _educated_? 

Most obviously, we're referring to their reception of a widely respected academic credential, typically a Bachelor's degree or higher. The presence of a degree is assumed to indicate the education one has received. But a degree does not _itself_ represent educational achievement, simply the completion of a course of study. Similar credentials can be purchased or falsified quite easily.

What, then, are the criteria for being educated? How much education, and in what subjects, must a person receive to be considered educated? What education must the informal learner receive to be considered equal to a degree-holder? 

This article aims to rigorously answer one specific question: what is the sum total of all knowledge and study implied by a typical 4-year Bachelor's degree in the United States?

The obvious starting point is the accreditation standards to which Bachelor's degree programs are held. The following research pertains specifically to semester-based publicly-funded 4-year universities in Colorado.

## Annotations
- In the United States, "education" typically refers specifically to *Liberal Arts* education. Here, the Liberal Arts are literature, philosophy, mathematics, history, and the sciences. While many college majors (Business, Engineering, Accounting, Nursing, etc.) are not considered Liberal Arts *degrees*, they nonetheless confer a Liberal Arts education.
- A standard Bachelor's degree typically requires the completion of no less than 120 credit-hours of coursework across all domains. This is typically divided into 8 semesters of 15 credit-hours. 1 credit-hour is widely understood to represent 1 hour spent in class plus 2 hours spent on assignments per week. Assuming 15 weeks of instruction per semester, each credit-hour represents roughly 45 hours of study. Based on this estimate, a typical Bachelor's degree requires 5400 total hours of coursework.

## Higher Learning Commission Accreditation
As relevant to this article's central question, Baccalaureate programs accredited by the Higher Learning Commission must:
- Maintain a minimum requirement of 30 credit-hours or equivalent of general education coursework. (1)(6)(a)
- Maintain an undergraduate general education program designed to impart broad knowledge and skills to students. (1)(6)(b)
- Require at least 120 credit-hours of coursework. (1)(6)(c)
- Maintain learning goals and outcomes that reflect rigor appropriate for collegiate coursework. (2)(3)(A)
- Engage students in collecting, analyzing, and communicating information, in practicing modes of intellectual inquiry, and in developing flexible skills. (2)(3)(B)

## §23-1-125 Requirements
Under C.R.S. §23-1-125, public Baccalaureate programs must:
- Consist of exactly 120 credit-hours of coursework, unless the program relates to a profession requiring additional study. (3)(2)
- Consist of 30-40 credit-hours of general education coursework. This coursework must cultivate the following skills in students: reading, critical thinking, written communication, mathematics, and technology. (3)(3)

## CDHE Implementation of §23-1-125
Section I part L of the CDHE Policy Manual defines a curriculum pursuant to §23-1-125. It does so with the explicit goal of standardizing the transfer of general education credits between public in-state colleges, establishing the Guaranteed Transfer (GT) Pathways system. 

While not universal, this curriculum is implemented by all public colleges and universities in Colorado (except the School of Mines) for all but a select few Baccalaureate programs. The curriculum consists of exactly 31 credit-hours of the following of coursework. (4)(7.00)
