What do we mean when we refer to someone as _educated_? 

Most obviously, we're referring to their reception of a widely respected academic credential, typically a Bachelor's degree or higher. The presence of a degree is assumed to indicate the education one has received. But a degree does not _itself_ represent educational achievement, simply the completion of a course of study. Similar credentials can be purchased or falsified quite easily.

What, then, are the criteria for being educated? How much education, and in what subjects, must a person receive to be considered educated? What education must the informal learner receive to be considered equal to a degree-holder? 

The obvious starting point is the accreditation standards to which Bachelor's degree programs are held. The following research pertains specifically to publicly-funded 4-year universities in Colorado.

## Annotations
- In the Western world, "education" typically refers specifically to *Liberal Arts* education. Here, the Liberal Arts are literature, philosophy, mathematics, history, and the natural sciences. While many college majors (business, engineering, accounting, nursing, etc.) are not considered Liberal Arts *degrees*, they nonetheless consist of a Liberal Arts education.
- An American Bachelor's degree typically requires the completion of no less than 120 credit-hours of coursework across all domains. This is typically divided into 8 semesters of 15 credit-hours. 1 credit-hour is widely understood to represent 1 hour spent in class plus 2 hours spent on assignments per week. Assuming 15 weeks of instruction per semester, each semester consists of 675 hours of coursework. Based on this estimate, a typical Bachelor's degree represents 5400 hours of study.
